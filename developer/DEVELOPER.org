   The issues have been resolved as of [2024-09-13 Fr 21:30]
   *My personal fork is no longer used.*
   
   1) *GOTCHA*: currently I have a fork of this action since that
      was the fastest way to fix an error

      * error was reported in [[https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action/issues/64][jekyll-deploy-action#64]]

      * the fix was proposed in: [[https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action/issues/64#issuecomment-1554834692][jekyll-deploy-action#64#issuecomment]]

      * I have forked [[https://github.com/malachi-constant/jekyll-deploy-action][malachi-constant/jekyll-deploy-action]] into
        [[https://github.com/pgpbpadilla/jekyll-deploy-action][pgpbpadilla/jekyll-deploy-action]] without changes

        - I had to create a tag in my fork: [[https://github.com/pgpbpadilla/jekyll-deploy-action/tags][jekyll-deploy-action/tags]]

        - then I updated my workflow definition to call my forked
          action in [[https://github.com/pgpbpadilla/pgpbpadilla.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml#L23][pgpbpadilla.github.io#jekyll.yml#L23]]
