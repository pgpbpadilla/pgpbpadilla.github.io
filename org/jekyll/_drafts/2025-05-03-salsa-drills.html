<p>
Here are some ideas for salsa dance practice, the main goals are to
train the ability to emphasize the pause at different times, as well
as to vary the sequence of steps and try all combinations. Have fun!
</p>


<p>
I started learning Salsa back in 2017 while I was living and working
in the Greater Seattle area. The class was taught at the <a href="https://centuryballroom.com">Century
Ballroom</a>, there I started my Salsa journey with the Basic step On 1,
LA Style.  
</p>

<h2 id="orgf904132"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> The Basic step On 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
For the Basic steps On 1, start by taking a step forward with the
left foot and stepping with your toe on beat 1 and the pause comes in
beat 4. Read on for an explanation of the following diagram.

<h3 id="symbols"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Remarks on symbols</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-symbols">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the beat: the first row shows the beat, in Salsa music there are
2 sets of 4 beats, 8 in total</li>
<li>home position: the beat 0 shows the initial position, some
people also call this the home position</li>
<li>transfer of weight: the red color in the steps indicates where
your body weight is supposed to be</li>
<li>only toes: the footprints without the heel mean that you are
only stepping with your toes</li>
<li>traveling foot: an arrow instead of a step shows the direction
your foot is traveling</li>
<li>step on the beat: the X in the last row mean that you need to
step on the beat</li>
<li>pause: the Ps in the last row tell you where the pause is
supposed to be</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
For reference, in the On 1 Basic, the pause is on beats 4 and 8. The
goal is now to move the Pause to a different beat. To simplify,
let's divide the eight beats into 2 sets of 4. This means that
the Pause is on beat 4 for each set of 4 beats.
</p>

<p>
Let's now deliberately pause on a different beat, e.g., 1, 2, or 3.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The same idea can be used to train the Pause when dancing On 2.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>now you have not only 2 ways to dance (On 1 and On 2); you have 8
ways to dance by choosing when to pause</li>
<li>you also have 2 additional ways to emphasize the Pause by steping
stricly on the clave beats, so that's 10 ways to dance already!</li>
<li>when making a Pause, you can do it softly or forcefully; during
practice anything goes but when dancing with a partner let the
music tell you if you should use soft long moves or short fast
ones</li>
</ol>
